# Learning Journal Week 3

## WordPress CMS & Group Interviews

### WordPress Site Creation:

This week's task involved creating a simple WordPress site for the startup project, carrying over content from the Joomla site created in the previous assignment. The focus was on familiarizing ourselves with WordPress rather than content development. I spent around 8 hours on this task, watching LinkedIn Learning videos and YouTube tutorials on setting up a child theme, and researching WordPress documentation for child themes.

### Insights from WordPress Child Themes:

Child themes emerged as a crucial aspect of WordPress development. They provide a way to make edits to existing themes without modifying the main theme. This not only allows for customization but also safeguards changes from being affected by updates to the main theme. I learned that using child themes is a best practice in WordPress development, ensuring that updates to the original theme do not overwrite any customizations.

### Career & Learning Insights:

The concept of child themes provided valuable insights into the workflow of website designers and developers. Child themes make styling more efficient and allow for changes without the fear of losing modifications during theme updates. As I explored this aspect, I realized the importance of these practices in the back-end development process.

However, I also acknowledged that the use of child themes might not align with my specific career goals. While it was interesting to understand the intricacies of back-end development, I am unsure if this is an area I wish to pursue in my future career. The learning experience highlighted the diversity of roles within web development and the importance of choosing a path that aligns with individual career aspirations.

### Group Formation:

The second part of the week involved a group formation exercise in preparation for the major group project. The task was to conduct one-minute job interview-style exercises with classmates to gather insights into their working styles, availability, diligence, and shared expectations. The notes from these interviews were recorded in the learning journal.

### Reflection:

The group formation exercise was insightful, providing a glimpse into the dynamics of potential team members. The process of asking questions and taking notes during the brief interviews offered a structured approach to forming groups based on compatibility and shared goals. This exercise not only contributes to the success of the upcoming group project but also serves as valuable material for employment-focused insights in the learning journal.

Overall, this week's activities deepened my understanding of WordPress development practices and emphasized the importance of effective group collaboration in project-based learning. The insights gained will undoubtedly shape my approach to both individual projects and future group work.
